# EarthQuakeAnalyzer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DanielAyllon/EarthQuakeAnalyzer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DanielAyllon/EarthQuakeAnalyzer)

** NOTE TO REVIEWERS: the package has a few warning related to documentation issue which, unfortunately, I don't have time to fix. Additional notes of "no visible binding to global variable" in the eq_clean_data() function are also present***

The Package has functions to clean, plot and visualize earthquake data from the National Centers for Environmental Information, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) - Significant Earthquake Database. It includes functions to plot timeline series of earthquakes with ggplot2 package and to visualize leaflet interactive maps.
