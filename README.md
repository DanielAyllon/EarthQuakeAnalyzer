# EarthQuakeAnalyzer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DanielAyllon/EarthQuakeAnalyzer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DanielAyllon/EarthQuakeAnalyzer)

This Package provides functions for handling earthquake records from the National Centers for Environmental Information, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) - Significant Earthquake Database. The package provides three main functionalities:
1) Data cleaning
2) Plotting timeline series of earthquakes with the ggplot2 package
3) Visualization of earthquake data through leaflet interactive maps

This package was prepared as the final assignment for the course **Mastering Software Development in R Capstone**, so it is not recommended for actual use.
